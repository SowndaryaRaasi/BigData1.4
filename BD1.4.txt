                                                   Big Data
                                               Assignment 1.4


1.Characteristics of Big data in detail:
        1.Volume:Huge amounts of data.
        2.Velocity:Speed at which data changes.
        3.Variety:Various types of data.
        4.Veracity:Trust worthiness of data interms of accuracy.
        5.Value:Final output produced after processing the data.

2.Possible solutions to handle Big data:
          1.Hadoop
          2.Apache cassandra
  

3.Differences between scaling up and scaling out:       
     Scaling up:Increasing the configuration (Hard disk,RAM etc.,) of a single machine to handle bigdata.
                       Challenges:Costly,Less Reliability.
     Scaling out: Increasing the resouces of multiple machines and then using them to handle large amounts of data.
                         Challenges:Handling failures of machines.
